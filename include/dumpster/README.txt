rakesh_*: an old sorting implementation that potentially used a Knuth
algorithm for forming runs longer than memory in the partition phase. The
code currently uses gotos however. The sort was considered optimized over
a even older version due to some modifications to the mergeheap. Some of
these optimizations have been carried over to the new sort, but the run
formation stuff has not. One may be interested in perusing the code and
seeing if anything is worth modernizing.
