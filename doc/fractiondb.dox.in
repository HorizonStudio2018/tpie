/**
\page fractiondb Fraction database

When using fractional progress reporting, TPIE is able to measure and remember
the proportion of execution time spent between the fractions.

The TPIE Hello world example program writes, sorts and verifies a stream of
numbers. In the source code we do not have to specify how much time writing
takes compared to sorting. Instead, we keep track of this information in an
auxiliary file.

If \c helloworld is compiled without the \c NO_FRACTION_STATS define, upon
exiting, the program will write the fraction database to a file named
\c fractiondb.gen.cpp. When compiled with the \c NO_FRACTION_STATS define, this
file is included in the source code.

The following example is from the \c main function in \c helloworld.cpp.

\code
@DOCCODE_FRACTIONDB@
\endcode
