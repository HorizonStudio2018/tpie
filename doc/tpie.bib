  abstract =     "Several algorithms for parallel disk systems have
                 appeared in the literature recently, and they are
                 asymptotically optimal in terms of the number of disk
                 accesses. Scalable systems with parallel disks must be
                 able to run these algorithms. We present a list of
                 capabilities that must be provided by the system to
                 support these optimal algorithms: control over
                 declustering, querying about the configuration,
                 independent I/O, turning off file caching and
                 prefetching, and bypassing parity. We summarize recent
                 theoretical and empirical work that justifies the need
                 for these capabilities.",

  abstract =     "We provide the first optimal algorithms in terms of
                 the number of input/outputs (I/Os) required between
                 internal memory and multiple secondary storage devices
                 for the problems of sorting, FFT, matrix transposition,
                 standard matrix multiplication, and related problems.
                 Our two-level memory model is new and gives a realistic
                 treatment of {\em parallel block transfer}, in which
                 during a single~I/O each of the $P$ secondary storage
                 devices can simultaneously transfer a contiguous block
                 of $B$ records. The model pertains to a large-scale
                 uniprocessor system or parallel multiprocessor system
                 with $P$ disks. In addition, the sorting, FFT,
                 permutation network, and standard matrix multiplication
                 algorithms are typically optimal in terms of the amount
                 of internal processing time. The difficulty in
                 developing optimal algorithms is to cope with the
                 partitioning of memory into $P$~separate physical
                 devices. Our algorithms' performance can be
                 significantly better than those obtained by the
                 well-known but nonoptimal technique of disk striping.
                 Our optimal sorting algorithm is randomized, but
                 practical; the probability of using more than $\ell$
                 times the optimal number of I/Os is exponentially small
                 in $\ell (\log \ell) \log (M/B)$, where $M$ is the
                 internal memory size.",
