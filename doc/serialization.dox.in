/**
\page serialization Serialization streams

\section sec_serintro Motivation

If you want to read and write text strings to TPIE streams, you have to set a
fixed string size if you want to use a \c file_stream.
In some cases this may be unreasonable:
space is wasted on strings that are smaller than the given size limit,
and it may be impossible to give a fixed upper bound on the length of the
strings a program has to operate on.

For this, TPIE provides a serialization framework with a special set of stream
readers and writers that support, in essence, variable-length item types, such
as strings and arrays.
With the library support for reversing and sorting such serialization streams,
it becomes reasonably easy to implement external memory algorithms operating on
variable length items.

\section sec_serusage Usage

The interface and usage is straightforward.
See the included test program \c lines, the bulk of which is reproduced below.
