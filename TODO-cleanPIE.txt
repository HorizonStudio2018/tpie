CleanPIE to-do:
===============

* Change to fit code-guidelines:
   - Namespace
   - One-class-per-file
   - Upper case
   - DoXyGen
   - Separate implementations from headers
   - Group methods by visibility (public, protected, private
* File cleanup:
   - Delete garbage
   - subdirectories
* Exceptions (end-of-file)
* New CMS
* Change licensing/copyright stuff (LGPL, headers in unified format)
* New Name?
* New WWW! (+place?)
* Rewrite manual

TPIE to-do:
===========

Do now (and then make distibution - before christmas):
------------------------------------------------------

* Make sure all we just did works:
   - sorting
   - Substreams
   - Streams without base class
   - Progress bar
   - Memory management

* Andy+Jan+Lars check manual

* Stack
   - Does it work?
   - Is it efficient?
   - Document at least in reference manual

* Queue
   - Is it efficient?
   - Include in distribution
   - Document at least in reference manual

Do soon (before CleanPIE! - some before distribution?):
-------------------------------------------------------

* Custom stream headers (as in block collection)

* ami_single_base -> ami_merge_object

* Merge heap + internal sort cleanup

* Document block + block collection

* Can different stream BTE's co-exist?
   - Do we want it?
   - Cleanup + update manual

Check-old stuff:
----------------

* Distribution:
   - Is it implemented?
   - Does it work?
* Key bucket sort:
   - Does it work?
   - Document at at least in reference manual
* Permuting
   - Does it work?
   - Remove all but general permuting?
   - Document at least in reference manual
* Matrix stuff
   - Does to work?
   - Remove or document.
* Distribution sweeping:
   - Is it there?
