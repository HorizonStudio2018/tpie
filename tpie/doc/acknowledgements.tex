The development of TPIE was supported in part by the National Science
Foundation under grant CCR-9007851 and by the U.S. Army Research
Office under grant DAAL03-91-G-0035.

I would like to thank the following people for helpful discussions
concerning algorithms and implementation techniques which influenced
the development of TPIE:
