	* magic_tpie: initial revision. To be used with the UNIX file(1)
	utility for checking TPIE file types.
	
	* test_ami_sort.cpp: Much nicer interface, usage printing.

	* test_ami_btree.cpp: Now has the option of leaving the files on
	disk after finishing, by giving a name on the command line.

	* Makefile.in: Big overhaul. No more .d files! Makefile now
	creates a file called Makefile.depend for all automatically
	generated dependencies.

	* There is a bog hole in time here, but now we start describing
	changes again!

	AMI_merge() code.

	* ami_scan.cpp (main): Got rid of call to init_tpie_logs(), since
	initialization is now done at construction time.
