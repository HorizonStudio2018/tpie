The manual contains a full account on how to build and use TPIE.
First generate the Makefiles using:

./configure

Run GNU make (gmake or /usr/local/bin/make on most systems):

/usr/local/bin/make all

This should build the entire distribution.

If you have problems, please consult the manual; there are some
requirements listed. Contact <tpie@cs.duke.edu> if you encounter other
problems.
