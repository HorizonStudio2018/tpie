This is the "to-do-list" - feel free to add stuff to it! Stuff that needs
to be done on the manual is include in the .tex files using \comment{} -
feel free to add stuff there too. Its better to add too much than to little!!

Emails (or just text) describing bugs, requests for new functionality, ect
can be found in the BUGemail directory. Fell free to add stuff there!

General:
--------

* Is the stack implementation ok?

* Cleanup #define in config.h
  - flags or macros?!

* Logging needs to be fixed
  - separate application program and TPIE internal logging

* Statistics
  - currently only in BTE_mmb; should be in all BTE's
  - should be accessible at AMI level

* Support for parallel disks
  - some code is probably present in merge_optimized.h and Rakesh should
    have a new BTE

* Clear up confusion between AMI and BTE stream types
  - make uniform naming and check that all AMI/BTE pairs works similarly
  - r_only flag in AMI?

* Clean up device stuff in ami_single.h (and other places)
  - what does it do?

* Remove PERSISTENT_READ_ONCE code

* Why isn't substream constructor a real constructer?
  - also; are BTE constructors ok? (separate names)

* Clean up files (did we remove all unused files?)

* Clean up bte_test.c program:
  - automatic run with set of parameters?
  - flag cleanup (READ_WRITE_TEST -> UFS_TEST)
  - prefetching operations?

MM:
---

* Introduce better name/mechanism for register_new
* rename mm_register.h to mm_single.h (?)
* clean up code

AMI:
----

* fix problem with constructor (bad path -> crash)
* AMI_merge_base should be AMI_merge_object
* Why so many AMI_MM_usage flags?
* Function objects in AMI_merge and AMI_sort (for improved efficiency)
* Cleanup/modification of ami_optimized_merge.h
  - introduction of function objects should help
  - add comparator class polymorph
  - add forecasting stuff (I think there is code in there already)?
* Distribution needs to be written
  - something probably available in kb_sort stuff
* Add distribution sweeping
  - also add spatial join example (SSSJ)
* Add index structures (when BTE_bcc done)
  - B-trees
  - R-trees
  - Priority queue
* Overlap last merge in sorting with computation (save scan)
  - can we maybe introduce a 'piping' mechanism?

BTE:
----

* BTE_STREAM_STATUS used?
  - if not remove!
* BTE_ufs cleanup
  - name should be BTE_stream_ufs instead of BTE_single_disk (for
    consistency)
  - Should we remove aio option?
* Block collection (BTE_bcc)
  - code for BTE exists in bcc_base.h and block_collection.h;
    needs to be cleaned-up/tested
  - code for AMI (typed view, ect) needs to be written
* Fix code that allows several BTEs to coexist
* Why is BTE_mmb not called BTE_mmp?
* madvice in BTE_mmb?
