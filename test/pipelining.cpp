/* This file should solve the following problem:
 * Given a graph consisting of (nodeid, parentid), find the number of children.
 * We solve this by sorting the input twice. Once by id, once by parent.
 * We then scan through both sorted streams at the same time, annotating each
 * (nodeid, parentid) with the number of nodes whose parentid is nodeid.
